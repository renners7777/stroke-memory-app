# Stroke Memory App

This project is a mobile application designed to support stroke survivors with memory issues and other related challenges. It is built using React Native and Expo, and it was initially based on the starter code provided by Firebase.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this application is to provide a set of tools and features that can help stroke survivors in their daily lives. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Memory aids and reminders
* Cognitive exercises
* A supportive community platform

## Future Plans

Once development and testing are complete, the goal is to launch this application on the Google Play Store to make it widely available to those who need it.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and the Expo CLI installed. You can then clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stroke-memory-app.git
cd stroke-memory-app
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the Expo developer tools in your browser. You can then use the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device to scan the QR code and run the app.

## Acknowledgements

This project was originally bootstrapped from a Firebase starter template for React Native and Expo. We are grateful to the Firebase team for providing a solid foundation for this application.
